# Global Cancer Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global cancer patient data to uncover patterns in demographics, risk factors, treatment costs, and survival outcomes using exploratory and statistical data analysis.

## ✅ Progress

- Project structure initialized
- Dataset integrated and organized
- Data understanding completed
- Data quality assessment performed
- Missing values and duplicate checks completed
- Statistical summary analysis documented
- Data validation and consistency checks completed
- Inferential statistical analysis performed
- Hypothesis testing conducted
- Economic and demographic impact analysis completed
- Key predictors of cancer severity and survival identified

## Status
🚧 Project in progress – Data Validation phase completed.  
Currently progressing to Inferential Analysis and Statistical Modeling.

✅ Inferential analysis completed.  
Project entering final documentation and insight summarization phase.

## 📊 Key Findings

- Lifestyle and genetic factors show stronger associations with cancer severity.
- Around 40% of cancers are diagnosed at early stages across cancer types.
- Treatment costs vary significantly across countries and age groups, highlighting global economic disparities.
- No statistically significant relationship was found between treatment cost and survival years.
- Cancer outcomes appear to be influenced by multiple interacting factors rather than a single variable.
