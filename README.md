# Global Cancer Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global cancer patient data to uncover patterns in demographics, risk factors, treatment costs, and survival outcomes using exploratory, statistical, and inferential data analysis techniques.

The goal is to understand factors influencing cancer severity, survival outcomes, and economic burden to support data-driven healthcare insights.

## 📊 Key Findings

- Lifestyle and genetic factors show stronger associations with cancer severity.
- Around 40% of cancers are diagnosed at early stages across cancer types.
- Treatment costs vary significantly across countries and age groups, highlighting global healthcare inequalities.
- No statistically significant relationship was found between treatment cost and survival years.
- Cancer outcomes are influenced by multiple interacting factors rather than a single dominant variable.

## 💡 Business & Healthcare Impact

The analysis highlights the importance of early cancer detection, preventive healthcare strategies, and efficient healthcare systems in reducing both medical severity and financial burden.

The findings emphasize that higher healthcare spending alone does not guarantee improved survival outcomes.
